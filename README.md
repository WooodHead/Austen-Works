## TODO

- [ ] An carefully crafted digital edition of _Pride and Prejudice_ is available from [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jane-austen/pride-and-prejudice); Textus Classics has a previous repository containing the same work. Both should be merged with the text in this repository.

All of Jane Austen’s major novels are present in this repository. They are originally taken and reformatted (from html to markdown) from the _Complete Collected Works_ as published by [Project Gutenberg, #31100](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31100).

- [ ] Nevertheless, Project Gutenberg also has the _Letters of Jane Austen_ ([PG 42078](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/42078/42078-h/42078-h.htm)), which thus is lacking from this repository, too.

- [ ] [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen#List_of_works) lists quite a few other works too: some unfinished fiction and other works, and three volumes of ‘Juvenilia’. Mos of these minor writings are lacking from this repository.

- [ ] [pemberley.com/janeinfo](http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/) has a seemingly exhaustive overview of all Jane’s writings, with many links to different (and annotated) digital online editions. It might be useful to merge and add these as well.
