## TODO

All of Jane Austen’s major novels are present in this repository. They were grabbed from the _Complete Collected Works_ as published by [Project Gutenberg, #31100](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31100), after which they have been converted (from html to markdown) and reformatted. For more info, please consult the commit history.

- [ ] A carefully crafted digital edition of _Pride and Prejudice_ is available from [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/jane-austen/pride-and-prejudice); Textus Classics has a [deprecated repository](https://github.com/textvs/Pride-and-Prejudice_1342) to an earlier release (February 2017) containing the same work. Both should be collated and merged with the text contained in this repository.

- [ ] Besides the main novels and minor posthumously published writings present in the PG Collected Works, Project Gutenberg also has the _Letters of Jane Austen_ ([PG 42078](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/42078/42078-h/42078-h.htm)), which is lacking from this repository.

- [ ] In addition, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen#List_of_works) lists quite a few other works: some unfinished fiction and other works, and three volumes of ‘Juvenilia’. Most of these minor writings are lacking from this repository.

- [ ] On [Pemberley.com](http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/) there’s what seems an exhaustive overview, listing all Jane Austen’s writings, with many links to different (and annotated) digital online editions. It might be useful to merge and add these as well.
